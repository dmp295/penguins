## Data
The data set contain body measurements of different species of penguins like bill length and depth, flipper length, and body mass as well as sex and the islands on which they were found.

## Single trait distribution
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm))
```
The shortest bill length looks to be about 6 and the longest about 59.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm, color=species))
```
Adelie penguins have the shortest bill lengths, which does not overlap much with the longer bill lengths of the other two species. Chinstrap penguins have the longest bill lengths, but their bill lengths overlap quite a bit with those of Gentoo penguins.
