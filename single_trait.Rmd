## Single trait distribution
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm))
```
The shortest bill length looks to be about 6 and the longest about 59.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm, color=species))
```
Adelie penguins have the shortest bill lengths, which does not overlap much with the longer bill lengths of the other two species. Chinstrap penguins have the longest bill lengths, but their bill lengths overlap quite a bit with those of Gentoo penguins.
